Title: Harnessing Machine Learning Techniques for Crop Prediction in Sustainable Agriculture: A Comprehensive Review

This desigined system investigates the utilization of various machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and XG Boost, in crop prediction for sustainable agricultural practices. Achieving sustainable farming necessitates precise predictions of crop yields and optimal resource management, underscoring the significance of ML in this domain. Drawing insights from a thorough examination of studies published in esteemed journals, this paper scrutinizes the effectiveness of these ML algorithms in crop prediction, leveraging input features such as nutrient levels, soil characteristics, and rainfall patterns of specific land areas.

Recent research underscores the efficacy of ensemble techniques like Random Forest and XG Boost in handling intricate agricultural datasets, while SVM has emerged as a robust classifier for crop classification based on diverse soil and climate variables. Additionally, logistic regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes have demonstrated their utility in crop yield prediction by modeling relationships between input features and crop outcomes.

Moreover, this paper proposes a comprehensive system architecture that integrates these ML algorithms with pertinent input features, aiming to develop a resilient crop prediction model. By harnessing advanced ML techniques and leveraging diverse input data, this proposed system seeks to optimize agricultural practices, boost crop productivity, and foster sustainable farming methods for a more resilient agricultural future.
